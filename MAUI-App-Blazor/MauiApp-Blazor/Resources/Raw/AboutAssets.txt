Any raw assets you want to be deployed with your application can be placed in
this directory (and child directories). Deployment of the asset to your application
is automatically handled by the following `MauiBuilding` Build Action within your `.csproj`.

    <MauiBuilding Include="Resources\Raw\**" LogicalName="%(RecursiveDir)%(Filename)%(Extension)" />

These files will be deployed with you package and will be accessible using Essentials:

    async Task LoadMauiBuilding()
    {
        using var stream = await FileSystem.OpenAppPackageFileAsync("AboutBuildings.txt");
        using var reader = new StreamReader(stream);

        var contents = reader.ReadToEnd();
    }
